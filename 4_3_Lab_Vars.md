# Exercise 4-3 Advanced: Calculating Total Cost in Gitpod

1. **Open Your Gitpod Workspace**: 
   - Ensure you're in your Gitpod workspace linked to your Java repository.

2. **Create a New Directory for the Package**: 
   - In the Gitpod interface (which is similar to VSCode), locate the File Explorer on the left sidebar.
   - Right-click on the directory where you want to add the new folder.
   - Choose "New Folder".
   - Name the folder `ex04_2_exercise`.

3. **Create a New Java Class Within the Folder**: 
   - Right-click on the newly created folder `ex04_2_exercise`.
   - Choose "New File".
   - Name the file `ShoppingCartAdvanced.java`.

4. **Define the Class and Package**: 
   - At the top of the `ShoppingCartAdvanced.java` file, define the package:
     ```java
     package ex04_2_exercise;
     ```
   - Below that, define the class:
     ```java
     public class ShoppingCartAdvanced {
     }
     ```
